        1. Make less use of ids and compounded selectors(nav ul li a) to select a element use classes instead
        2. Use comments to explain styling
        3. Do styling in orgainzed and serial way:
            global variables
            global stylings
            typography
            navbar
            header
            sections
            footer
            media queries
        4. Refactoring: After writing enough amount of CSS, do check whether you have wrote same styling multiple times, if you have then grouped them in one, it will make it more readeable and quickly replacable    
        5. if you are doing ":focus {outline: none;}" because, the default styling doesn't looks good, then, make sure you copy the styling of :hover into :focus , because many users navigate the site using keyboard
